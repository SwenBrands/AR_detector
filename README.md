Python scripts and functions to detect Atmospheric Rivers in reanalysis and climate model data, implemented for use on the Finisterrae 3 High Performance Cluster of the Galician Center for Supercomputing (CESGA).

This software package was developed from the Matlab scripts used in https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3095-6 and, after being brought to Python, was applied in https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD030936. Atmospheric rivers are detected at each grid-box of a spatial domain the user can define. A detailed algorithm description can be found in my PhD thesis available from:
